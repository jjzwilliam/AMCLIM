# AMCLIM
This is the working directory for the development of the AMmonia-CLIMate, so-called, AMCLIM, which is a dynamical process-based emission model to quantify ammonia emissions from agricultural practices.
Currently, there are three sub-directories, namely a) input_files, b) model, and c) outputs.

Model inlcudes three main modules (components) for simulations, namely a) HOUSING, b)MMS, c)LAND.

You are enouraged to contact Jize Jiang (jize.jiang@usys.ethz.ch/jize.jiang@ed.ac.uk) for further information/how to use the model etc.
